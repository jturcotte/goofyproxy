=== goofyproxy ===
goofyproxy acts as an HTTP proxy that filters received data
through an external application.

To use it, run it and go in network preferences of your browser to configure
localhost:PORT as proxy for HTTP connections.


=== Build ===
- Get the Qt Library version 4.5.0 or higher
- Run:
  qmake && make


=== Usage ===
goofyproxy PORT CONTENTTYPEPREFIX COMMAND [COMMANDARGS]
Open an HTTP proxy on port PORT.
Each response with a Content-Type that starts with CONTENTTYPEPREFIX gets
its payload sent through COMMAND's stdin. Stdout is sent back to the client.

Example: goofyproxy 8080 text/html sed '{s/<p\([> ]\)/<h1\1/; s/<\/p>/<\/h1>/}'
         would change every occurence of <p></p> for <h1></h1> in html objects.


=== Supported platforms ===
Linux, Mac OS X

A serious issue is often seen on Windows machines, at least on my setup,
where the client connection would be closed automatically when putting
the software under medium load.


=== Limitations ===
- HTTPS is not supported
